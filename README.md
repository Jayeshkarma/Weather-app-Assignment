##  Future Improvements

1. Add animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and make the app feel more interactive.
2. Implement a search feature that allows users to search for weather information by location or city name.
3. Add support for multiple languages by implementing localization. Allow users to switch between different languages for the app's text content.
4. Provide options for users to choose their preferred unit of measurement for temperature (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit)

## Additional Features
1. Implement a feature that allows users to save their favorite locations and view weather information for those locations quickly.
2. Include a forecast graph or chart that visually represents the temperature or precipitation changes over a specific period.
3. Add a feature to display additional weather details, such as humidity, wind direction, UV index, or sunrise/sunset times.
4. Provide an option for users to share the weather information with others through social media or messaging platforms.
5. Implement push notifications to alert users about significant weather changes or important updates.
